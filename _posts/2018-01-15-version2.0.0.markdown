# New year, new numbro!


**numbro 2.0.0** has just been released, and it's a complete rewrite of the code.

Hopefully, numbro 2.0.0 is 99% backward compatible with the previous version (1.11.1).

Breaking changes are:

- `unformat` is now a static function instead of an instance method (`numbro.unformat(myString)` instead of `numbro(whatever).unformat(myString)`)
- not precising a mantissa now means to keep them all while it used to mean to trim it off (`numbro(123.456).format(0,0)` now is `123.234` instead of `123`)


On the other side, this version brings some cool features in:

- From a usage point of view:
	- a better formatting format, now using a literal object for an improved readability (note that the string format is still supported) 
	- support for [BigNumber](https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js/), so no more rounding issues
	- defaults are now language specific, bringing more flexibility
	
- From a code point of view:
	- the code is now split into modules, making it easier to read, to test and to maintain
	- usage of the [ES6](http://es6-features.org/) specification, for an up-to-date codebase
	- usage of [eslint](http://eslint.org/), a javascript linter for cleaner code
	- usage of [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), for more advanced testing (while keeping all previous tests)
	- usage of [istanbul](https://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/), ensuring a **100%** test coverage ratio!

More details can be found in the [PR #305](https://github.com/BenjaminVanRyseghem/numbro/pull/305)
